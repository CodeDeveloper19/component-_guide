So your branch name should look like &apos;feat/game-card-selection-component&apos;. Your code for creating your branch should look the one below:</p><div className="w-full bg-zinc-950 break-words p-4 rounded-lg my-[10px]"><p className="text-gray-100"><span className="text-yellow-300">git</span> checkout <span className="text-gray-600">-b</span> feat/game-card-selection-component</p></div></div><div className="w-full flex flex-col gap-[10px]"><h3 className="text-[18px] leading-[24px] font-bold mb-[10px]">Adding upstream</h3><p>To pull recent changes from the remote GitHub repo, you will need to add the web URL leading to the repository.</p><p>Run the code below to do that.</p><div className="w-full bg-zinc-950 break-words p-4 rounded-lg my-[10px]"><p className="text-gray-100"><span className="text-yellow-300">git</span> remote add upstream https://github.com/hngprojects/bingo_fe.git</p></div></div><div className="w-full flex flex-col gap-[10px]"><h3 className="text-[18px] leading-[24px] font-bold mb-[10px]">Installing node modules</h3><p>The project makes use of pnpm to manage its packages.

This would help eliminate errors relating to package not found when importing into a file.</p></div><div className="w-full flex flex-col gap-[10px]"><h3 className="text-[18px] leading-[24px] font-bold mb-[10px]">Merging changes to your branch</h3><p>Before creating commits and pushing, you will need fetch and merge changes made on the remote repository to your local machine to avoid merge conflicts.</p><p>After fulfilling the adding upstream step, you can go ahead and run the code below to fetch the changes:</p><div className="w-full bg-zinc-950 break-words p-4 rounded-lg my-[10px]"><p className="text-gray-100"><span className="text-yellow-300">git</span> fetch upstream</p></div><p>Then go ahead and merge these changes from the &apos;dev&apos; branch of the upstream to your current local branch.</p><div className="w-full bg-zinc-950 break-words p-4 rounded-lg my-[10px]"><p className="text-gray-100"><span className="text-yellow-300">git</span> merge upstream/dev</p></div></div><div className="w-full flex flex-col gap-[10px]"><h3 className="text-[18px] leading-[24px] font-bold mb-[10px]">Making commits</h3><p>When making commits, you should start your commit meassage with &apos;feat&apos; if you are working on a component/feature and &apos;page&apos; if it&apos;s a full page.</p><p>Your commit syntax should look like the code below</p><div className="w-full bg-zinc-950 break-words p-4 rounded-lg my-[10px]"><p className="text-gray-100"><span className="text-yellow-300">git</span> commit <span className="text-gray-600">-m</span> &apos;feat: /*your commit message*/&apos;</p></div><p>Also, your commit message should be short and concise, explaining what your changes are doing.</p></div><div className="w-full flex flex-col gap-[10px]"><h3 className="text-[18px] leading-[24px] font-bold mb-[10px]">Pushing your changes/commit</h3><p>Normally, when you clone into your local machine, the web URL leading to the remote repo is added as your origin.</p><p>If not, you can run the code for adding upstream and swap &apos;upstream&apos; with &apos;origin&apos;.</p><div className="w-full bg-zinc-950 break-words p-4 rounded-lg my-[10px]"><p className="text-gray-100"><span className="text-yellow-300">git</span> remote add origin https://github.com/hngprojects/bingo_fe.git</p></div><p>Then, push your branch to the remote repo.</p><div className="w-full bg-zinc-950 break-words p-4 rounded-lg my-[10px]"><p className="text-gray-100"><span className="text-yellow-300">git</span> push origin feat/game-card-selection-component</p></div><p>Remember, you need to fetch recent changes on the remote repo and commit it to your branch first to avoid conflicts.</p></div></div>

            <p>After pushing your branch and its commits, you should on ahead to the remote repo of the project and make a pull request containing details of your feature/page implementation.

            <p>And for the body, it should include screenshots of the feature you implementated, screenshots of the figma design, link to the page/component&apos;s figma design, and a short video showing how your implementation works preferably.</p>
